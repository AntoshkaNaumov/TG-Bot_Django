In my project I have created a backend service for telegram-bot.
This bot will help us in remembering the kind words of the German language.
The Backend is implemented using Django Rest Framework and it performs 2 functions: gives a random word in the German language, stating the kind of words or gives the following (provided pk) word in the database.
The task telegram-bot is a request 10 words, to verify the correctness of the answers or query the words in a row, until you reset it exercise or run out of words in the database.

When you create a REST API used DRF Class Base Views.
